/**
 * EscalationCard — a crew member asking the person for a decision.
 *
 * Drawn for `escalation` rows (meta.kind === 'escalation'). The body is the
 * member's own markdown (summary / what was tried / what is needed); the card
 * adds the who/when frame around it: which member, from which session, the
 * decision window with a live countdown, the default that applies if nobody
 * answers, and the options as a single-choice list (same list QuestionCard
 * draws) with ONE send button that replies with the chosen option, tagged with
 * the escalation id so the backend answers exactly this request. State is
 * derived by the host from the transcript — see escalationState.ts — and the
 * card re-derives the closed states against its own ticking clock, so a
 * pending card flips to expired/defaulted the moment the deadline passes.
 *
 * This is the Crew Members chat profile's card, the ONE place an escalation can
 * be answered in-thread; every other surface draws the SDK default
 * (`pages/chat/EscalationNotice`), which points here. With no member name the
 * title names the sending session instead.
