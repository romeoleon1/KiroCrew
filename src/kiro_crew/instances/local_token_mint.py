"""Token mint for the ``loopback`` transport — no ssh, no ssm, no forwarder.

The ssh and ssm minters reach a REMOTE shell and run ``kirocrew token`` there.
A loopback instance has no remote: the destination gateway is already listening
on this host's own loopback, and it exposes the mint over HTTP at
``/api/token/local``, gated on the internal secret it wrote for its own port.
So this module dials that endpoint directly — the same call
:func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.mint_token` makes, and deliberately modelled on it,
including its refusal to proceed on an unproven listener.

**Which credential, and why it is per port.** ``run/gateway-<port>.secret``
belongs to ONE gateway generation, is written ``0600`` inside the ``0700``
``run/`` dir, and is the value that gateway's auth middleware compares against.
This module reads only that file and never falls back to the shared
``.local_secret``: that file is last-writer-wins per data home, so on a host
running two gateways it names whichever started most recently, and sending it to
the other one both fails and puts a live credential on the wire for a listener
it does not authenticate. The per-port file is the credential paired with the
listener actually being dialled.

**When a listener must prove itself.** A port carries no evidence of who holds
it, and the credential goes on the wire before any reply comes back — so the
question "is a Kiro Crew gateway of mine listening there" has to be answered
first. There is exactly one case where it needs no answer: when the destination
is this gateway's OWN bound port AND this gateway's socket answers on loopback,
the listener is this very process, and there is no second party to prove
anything about. Port equality alone does NOT establish that — a gateway bound to
one interface (``KIROCREW_BIND=192.168.1.5``) leaves ``127.0.0.1`` on its own
port free for any other local process. For every other port
:func:`kiro_crew.port_resolution.port_is_gateway_owned` must confirm the
listener is this user's gateway, and the mint is REFUSED when it cannot — never
downgraded to "send it anyway and see". That is the same posture, for the same
reason, as ``pod.runtime.mint_token``: refusing a live gateway costs an error
message, while proceeding on an unproven port hands a credential to whatever
answered.

**What the proof does not cover: the address.** ``port_is_gateway_owned``
attributes the listener on a port and is documented address-agnostic, while the
request is made to an (address, port) pair. The two are only the same question
on the address this gateway binds, so ``127.0.0.1`` is the one accepted
destination — refused both by ``validate_loopback_host`` and again here, since a
process holding ``127.0.0.2:P`` while a gateway holds ``127.0.0.1:P`` would
otherwise satisfy a port-granular proof and be handed the secret. Widening the
destination set belongs with an (address, port)-granular proof.

The token is returned in memory only and is never logged.

    A gateway bound to ONE interface (``KIROCREW_BIND=192.168.1.5``) serves

    whether an IPv6 wildcard accepts IPv4 loopback depends on
    ``bindv6only``, and a wrong guess in this direction hands out a credential.
