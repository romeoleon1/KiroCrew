"""Check that a security fix killed the finding and broke nothing legitimate.

A fix that makes the proof of concept stop reproducing has done half a job. The
other half is the half a security change actually gets rejected for: the deny
fence grew a rule that also refuses ``gh pr view --json``, or a path guard now
rejects the operator's own worktree, and the tool the fix protected became one
nobody can use. Two failure modes -- **the tool became unusable** and **platform
lock-in** -- and the ``golden_paths`` table is their corpus: the legitimate
operations every security fix must keep alive. Both are nameable from this
repository's own history rather than from any clause: read-only ``gh pr view
--json`` shapes have been refused by a widened rule, and a guard written against
one host's interpreter path has cost the other host's test lane.

So this is a two-step gate, and both steps must hold::

    python3 verify_fix.py [--db PATH] --finding-id N --worktree DIR \\
        [--platform auto|posix|windows] [--timeout SECONDS]

1. ``verify_finding.py`` re-runs the proof. The fix holds ONLY when that pass
   comes back ``rejected`` -- the proof does not reproduce any more.
   ``confirmed`` means the fix did not land, and anything else means the question
   was not settled.
2. Every ACTIVE ``shell`` golden path whose platform matches the host is
   re-classified against the FIXED code. None of them may be refused.

Exit codes, which are the interface::

    0   holds        -- the proof is dead and every shell golden path is permitted
    10  reproduces   -- the proof still reproduces; the fix did not land
    30  broken       -- at least one golden path is refused (the rows are
                        printed); this is the "tool became unusable" rejection
    20  unverifiable -- something this script owns could not be settled: the
                        verifier is absent, the deny fence is not readable
    2   invalid input -- a bad argument, or a worktree that is not a checkout

Precedence when several apply is ``10 > 30 > 20 > 0``, and it is not arbitrary. A
proof that still reproduces means the fix does not exist yet, so what it did to
the golden paths is not yet a question. A broken golden path outranks an
unverifiable one because it is the actionable verdict: a named row, a named
reason, something to change. And **0 is unreachable while any check this script
owns went unsettled** -- an unclassified golden path is not a permitted one, and
reporting it as one is how a fix that broke the tool ships green.

stdout is one JSON object, carrying ``broken``, ``unverifiable`` and
``needs_human`` as lists of rows, so a reviewer gets the specific operations
rather than a count.

**Nothing out of the ledger is ever executed.** That is the load-bearing rule
here, and it is what decides how each kind is treated:

``shell``
    Classified by the deny fence, never run. The claim a shell row makes is "the
    fence must not refuse this", so classification answers it exactly and running
    the command would answer a different question. The verdict is read from
    ``kiro_crew.security.is_denied``, which returns a refusal reason or ``None``.
    It is called in a CHILD process with the worktree's own ``src`` ahead of
    everything on ``PYTHONPATH``, because the point is to classify against the
    FIXED code: importing it in this process would bind whatever copy of the
    package the interpreter already loaded, which for a test runner inside the
    repository is the unfixed one. When the import fails, every shell row is
    ``unverifiable`` and the verdict is 20 -- a fence that cannot be read is not a
    fence that agreed.

``flow`` and ``cron``
    Recorded, reported, and left to a human. Neither is executed and neither
    moves the exit code, because neither is a check this script can make:

    * A ledger row is not authorization. ``ledger.py`` states plainly that its
      CLI is not an authentication boundary -- ``--approved-by`` is an unverified
      caller assertion -- so a row is untrusted text written by whatever can
      reach the database. Every other consumer only READS such a row; running one
      as argv would turn a ledger write into command execution with the
      operator's access, which is a privilege escalation the ledger's own
      docstring says it cannot gate. No containment fixes that: the escalation is
      in treating the row as permission, not in how the child is confined.
    * A schedule is worse than unhelpful to execute -- firing one has effects
      outside the worktree that no deadline bounds -- and parsing it here would
      settle nothing either, because a parse in THIS process never consults the
      fixed code, so its answer is a constant no fix can change.

    Their value is the corpus, not a verdict: they name the operations
    (``monitor_start``, a chat turn, a shipped cron) a human has to exercise, and
    they are printed for exactly that. The shipped corpus's own well-formedness is
    asserted in the test suite, at review time, where a corpus-authoring mistake
    belongs.

Trust boundary. The target checkout is the operator's own code, which they chose
to run as themselves; containment for the verifier child is that disposable
checkout plus the deadline, not a sandbox. What this script adds on top is the
rule above: the ledger is data, never an instruction.

Reads one SQLite file through ``ledger.py`` and runs two kinds of child process --
the sibling verifier and its own classifier probe. No network of its own.
