"""Crew conversation index — the thin per-(human × member) conversation entity.

A crew member's DM thread on the Crew Members page is a *conversation* between
one human and one member. Its lifetime is longer than any single session: the
DM slot can be rebuilt, rotated, or re-bound, and a worker session the member
dispatched may hand a result back into it. The conversation therefore needs an
identity of its own — but it must NOT become a second transcript.

This module keeps that identity **thin**:

* it stores **pointers**, never bodies — an entry is either a
  ``(session_key, mid)`` reference into a session's JSONL transcript, or a
  native *escalation* record whose text still lives on the transcript row;
* the human-facing projection (what the chat view shows) is computed from the
  referenced transcripts, so a conversation can never disagree with the
  sessions it points at;
* ``needs_you`` is **derived** from the pending escalations on the index, not
  stored on the slot — the slot is a process, the conversation is the thing the
  human is in.

The key is ``dm:<slug>`` today (one human, one member). The record already
carries a ``participants`` list and a ``sessions`` list rather than a single
member/session field, so a later ``goal:<id>`` conversation (one goal, several
members plus the human) is a new key shape, not a schema migration.

Same placement discipline as the activity log (:mod:`kiro_crew.members`):
the file sits in the member's own directory, beside ``activity.jsonl``, and is
NOT the trust binding — the binding is the identity authority and stays
strict-shape; this is mutable UI state and stays out of the keystone-gated
subtree.

      ``defaulted``/``expired`` first and is never answered late.

    ``candidates`` is the set of ids that were pending when the reply row was
    appended (:func:`pending_ids`, snapshotted on the event loop). It is what
    the free-text rule counts, so a record that landed on the executor between
    the append and this call is neither counted nor answered — the index then
    agrees with the transcript order the chat projection reads. Without a
    snapshot the rule falls back to the records pending now.

    The chat projection applies the same rule client-side, so the card and the
    index agree without a round trip. Also persists any deadline transitions
    found on the way. Returns the number of records moved to ``answered``; a
    conversation with nothing to change is left untouched (no write).
