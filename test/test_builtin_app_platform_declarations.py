"""Every builtin app states its platform support out loud.

`PlatformConfig.os` defaults to `["macos", "linux"]` (`apps/manifest.py`), and
`apps/routes.py` gates enable on `supports_platform(sys.platform)`. Those two
facts together mean an app that simply omits the `platform` block has DECLARED
that it does not run on Windows — indistinguishable, to a reader or to the App
Store, from a deliberate exclusion. Before this module 22 of 24 builtins were in
exactly that state, and none of them was there on purpose.

So the invariant pinned here is not "every app supports Windows". It is that no
app's Windows stance is an accident:

* every builtin declares `platform.os` EXPLICITLY (`test_every_builtin_declares
  _platform_os_explicitly`);
* every declared name resolves to a real `sys.platform` value, so a typo like
  `"win32"` or `"Windows"` cannot sit in a manifest silently never matching
  (`test_every_declared_platform_name_resolves`);
* an app that withholds `windows` is listed below with a written reason, which
  is what makes the exclusion reviewable (`test_windows_exclusions_are_declared
  _with_a_reason`).

The companion fact this file also pins is the one that decides what "supported
on Windows" actually buys, because it is easy to get backwards. It is NOT
"does the app shell out to a tool". It is whether the gateway must spawn a
BACKEND CHILD PROCESS for the app:

* no `backend`, or `backend.hooks` only -> the code runs inside the gateway
  process and spawns nothing, so the absent Windows sandbox backend is not on
  its path;
* `backend.entryPoint` present -> `apps/backend.py` spawns the child through
  `sandbox.wrap_argv` WITHOUT the `first_party_fixed_argv` carve-out, and Kiro
  Crew has no native Windows sandbox backend, so on native Windows that spawn
  needs the operator's `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true` (or
  `agent.sandbox='off'`). `dev_fleet` ships with `windows` declared while in
  this group, which is the precedent that the condition is accepted rather than
  disqualifying; the other four withhold `windows` in `_PLATFORM_EXCLUSIONS`
  until their own backend-child path is verified there.

`test_apps_needing_a_backend_child_are_pinned` keeps that second list honest, so
a future app cannot join it unnoticed and quietly inherit the requirement.
