"""``verify_fix.py`` — the two-step gate, and the verdict it must never reach.

The properties pinned here are the ones a prompt cannot hold. A fix is verified
only when the proof stops reproducing AND every legitimate operation still works,
so the interesting assertions are all about the verdict LADDER: a proof that still
reproduces outranks everything, a broken golden path is a rejection, and
``holds`` is unreachable while any golden path went unchecked.

The script is driven as a SUBPROCESS with its siblings staged beside it, because
that is the contract that matters: it finds ``verify_finding.py`` and ``ledger.py``
as files next to itself, so a property that holds only when the module is imported
into the test process would not be the property the harness relies on. Staging the
directory is also what makes the absent-verifier case testable at all.

The deny fence is reached through ``--classifier-cmd``, the declared testing seam:
a stub answering the probe protocol lets a refusal be arranged deliberately
instead of hoping the real fence refuses something. One class at the end does use
the REAL fence, and asserts the shipped corpus against it -- that is the corpus's
whole purpose, and a test that stubbed it would assert nothing about the rows.

The other property with its own class is that NOTHING out of the ledger is
executed. A ``flow`` or ``cron`` row is untrusted text -- the ledger CLI is not an
authentication boundary -- so running one would turn a database write into a
command with the operator's access. Those tests plant a witness file a row would
create if it ran, and assert it never appears.

    ``--approved-by`` is an unverified caller assertion, so a row is untrusted text
    written by whatever can reach the database. Running one as argv would turn a
    ledger write into command execution with the operator's access -- a privilege
    escalation no containment fixes, because the escalation is in treating the row
    as permission. So a non-shell row is reported for a human and never run.

    Each test plants a witness file the row would create if it ran.
